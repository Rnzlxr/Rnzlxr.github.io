# About Me

## My Interests
Hello! My name is Yusif, and I have a passion for martial arts, specifically Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am currently training to go pro in both sports, focusing on getting stronger and more agile every day. Besides my love for martial arts, Iâ€™m also deeply involved in cybersecurity, where I am learning about ethical hacking and penetration testing. Additionally, I am working on my project management skills through the Google Project Management Certificate course. These fields allow me to merge my interest in problem-solving with hands-on technical work, which I find both challenging and rewarding.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring various aspects of fitness, especially when it comes to building strength and improving conditioning for combat sports. I also like to stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends and advancements, particularly those in the realm of cybersecurity and project management.
